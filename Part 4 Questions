Set 7
1) Critters utilize the methods act(), getActors(),processActors(),getMoveLocations(),selectMoveLocations(), and makeMove().
2)getActors(),processActors(),getMoveLocations(),selectMoveLocations(), and makeMove().
3)Sub Classes of critters should be able to override getActors() incase actors are made from different locations
4)Each critter can kill/each another actor, change another actos color, and/or make the other actors move.
5)Each critter first uses getMoveLocations(), then selectMoveLocations(), and finally uses makeMove() to move locations.
6)There is no critter constructor because it extends Actor and inherits all constructors from Actor.


Set 8
1)A chameleon reacts differently from a critter without overriding act because it processes actors differently. It has it's own processActors() method.
2)Chameleon utilized super.makeMove in order to complete all of the processes that a critter does because it does not override the act() method.It will process like a Chameleon first and then act like a critter while moving.
3)In order to drop a flower, you would have to alter the makeMove() method for the Chameleon.
4)ChameleonCritter and Critter both process the same actors and therefore would be wasting time and adding in more room for error.
5)The Actor class contains getLocation() method.
6)A critter can call getGrid() from the Actor class.

Set 9
1)CrabCritter processes actors the same way that a Critter does but eats an critter around it. It would make more room for error to rewrite the code.
2)CrabCritter will eat any actor within 1 grid to it's front,left, or right. All others are left alone.
3)The method is used to try and find out the path of other critters in order to "hunt" them down.
4)The Crab can go to the south, east, or west to (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5).
5)A Crab will only move to it's left or right while a critter can move in all directions.
6)If the Crab is already in a locatioon given by loc, it will turn and not move.
7)In processActors(), the CrabCritter will only eat other bugs and actors that are not Critters or Rocks.
