1)Yes, the bug will move to a new spot on the world even if it's path is blocked.
It wil turn until the path is clear and continue to move on the world.

2)The bug always moves forward relative to its location.  The face of the bug acts as
the front and the direction it will move.

3)If the bug cannot move forward, it rotates to the right by 45 degrees until the front is
clear for it to continue moving.

4)The bug leaves behind a flower that eventually decays over time.

5)The walls act as barriers that make the bug turn and move a different direction. 

If facing a wall, it will continue to rotate, and if it is not facing the wall, it will continue forward 
until it hits the next wall.

6)The bug will rotate 45 degrees and try to move out of the way.

7)No, a flower only decays over time.

8)A flower fades/decays over time.

9)A rock does not have any behavior nor does it move. It only acts as a wall.

10)No, only 1 actor can be on a grid at the same time.  If a flower is present however, the bug can move 
ontop of the flower, estroying it and place a new one.

2) You can move the bug to any x,y coordinate on the grid. If you try to move the bug outside of the grid, an
eror message pops up.

3)You use void setColor() to change the color of an actor.

4)The bug gets squashed under the rock.
