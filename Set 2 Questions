1)The instance variable sideLength tells the bug/actor how long each side of the box is and
how far o go before turning.

2)The instance variable steps tells the bug how many grids/steps it has curently gone on a
given side length.  Once steps = sidelength, the bug/actor the bug turns 90 degrees.

3)The turn methods is called upon twice so that the bug turns 90 degrees and not 45 to create a square.

4)Move can be called in the BoxBug class because it extends to the actor class and uses any public methods or
variables in Actor.

5)Yes, as long as the bug is able to create a square, it will move around in order to make a given size square
and remain that size.

6)Yes, if the front is blocked and the bug has not reached the given sideLength, it will move around the grid in order
to make the given size box.

7)The value of steps is zero right after the bug has made a 90 degree turn.
